Talent Track - AI-Powered Fitness Analysis
Hackathon Submission
What Died
Push-ups, Pull-ups, Sit-ups
Shuttle Run, Vertical Jump
Sit & Reach, Broad Jump
It motivated millions but died due to:

Manual testing was time-consuming
No real-time feedback
Inconsistent scoring
Lack of engagement for digital natives
What We Brought Back
Talent Track resurrects this iconic program with modern AI:

AI-Powered Analysis: MediaPipe pose detection replaces manual counting
Real-Time Feedback: Instant form validation with skeleton overlay
Consistent Scoring: AI ensures fair, accurate measurements
Gamification: Challenges and leaderboards engage today's generation
Accessibility: Anyone with a camera can participate
All 7 Original Tests: Complete Presidential Fitness Test suite
Why It Matters Today
Fitness Crisis: Youth obesity has tripled since the program ended
Digital Solution: Meets kids where they are (on screens)
Scalability: AI enables millions to test simultaneously
Data-Driven: Track progress over time with detailed metrics
Motivation: Gamification drives engagement better than ever

🎥 How It Works
User uploads video or records live
Backend receives video and spawns Python process
Python script processes video:
Detects body landmarks with MediaPipe
Tracks joint angles
Counts reps/jumps
Validates form
Draws skeleton overlay
Generates annotated video
Backend returns results to frontend
User views annotated video with statistics
📊 Output Data
Annotated Video
MP4 format with skeleton overlay
Colored lines connecting joints
Joint markers (dots)
On-screen metrics (reps, angles, timer)
Form indicators
CSV Data
Detailed metrics per rep:

Timestamps
Joint angles
Duration
Form validation
Performance statistics
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.8+ - Download
Node.js 16+ - Download
Webcam (optional, for live recording)
